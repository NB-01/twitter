Our commercial strategy is helping us reach millions of patients around the world. And most important, we continue to see volume gains, as opposed to pricing gains, driving our business.We expect to close the Array acquisition very soon. And we just announced the proposed agreement with Mylan for our Upjohn business. When all these actions are complete, Pfizer will be a smaller, more focused, science-based company with a singular focus on innovative Pharma.I just wrapped our second-quarter 2019 analyst call where I addressed our recent activities to re-shape . We recently completed the Therachon acquisition and are about to create the JV with GSK for our consumer business.Congratulations to Michael Goettler on being named CEO of the combined company. Having worked closely with him for many years I'll be sorry to see him leave Pfizer, but I know he is the right person to help it seize the opportunity that lies ahead.  Today's announcement reflects our sharpened focus on innovative medicines and will strengthen our ability to fulfill our purpose: Breakthroughs that change patients' lives. Pfizer has agreed to combine Upjohn, our off-patent branded and generic business, with Mylan, creating a new champion for global heath - one poised to bring world-class medicines to patients across a wide range of therapeutic areas. Revenues were up 2% operationally company-wide in Q2 with the Biopharmaceuticals Group growing its topline 6% operationally. I continue to be excited with the progress of our R&amp;D pipeline. Since April 30, we have received seven approvals for new medicines or indications.It's an exciting day here at . We reported solid second-quarter 2019 financial results and announced that our Upjohn business will combine with Mylan to create a new company uniquely positioned to fulfill the world's evolving medicine needs.",9.0,117.0,555.0,0.5426695526695526,0.19904160654160655,0.4278868618154333,0.0,0.06374181692890778,0.06260206859009254
