Interesting thoughts from FRYER REPORTS last night ...
""The most extreme (but possible) outcome would be for Argentine wheat to become virtually unsellable on the world market, with the consequent catastrophic impact on world wheat prices.""    it depends on the contract terms &amp; how the export ban is defined. If it is sale from a specific plant that cannot export then it is a clear case of prohibition and seller cannot fulfil.
Tricky thing is that disputes will often be in the jurisdiction of the domicile of the seller!   You can sit down now ;)  Which entity governs arbitration for such fertiliser disputes?   Talking about fertilisers from China 🇨🇳 , not wheat  No: if it is an explicit Government export ban from a specific origin then the seller can claim Prohibition / Force Majeure and contract can simply be cancelled. Unforeseen circumstances.

The Taliban will want to ensure food supplies are not disrupted, so I guess that funds and security will be arranged to continue the usual flow.

Olam : 60k 💥 Algeria 🇩🇿 OAIC wheat 🌾 tender closing date 2/8/21
Shipment 1-15th September&amp; 16-30th September for a nominal 50,000 MT of milling wheat 🌾.. they’ll probably buy 500,000 mt… _awadalla Is the best metaphor for Gasc a rodeo 🐎 .. or a casino 🎰 ?  There are many moving parts, as ever, but overall the focus has been too much on supply ( with some overly optimistic prognosis in certain areas) &amp; not sufficiently on demand 🐮 Milling wheat 🌾 prices should be supported &amp; spreads with Feed wheat should widen 🍞  By Autumn wheat prices should be higher 🍂 … agree than much demand isn’t sufficiently covered!🌾 Wheat Stocks of major exporters are at an all time low, except 🇺🇸

World wheat 🌾 buyers who are *hoping* for cheaper prices should look to buy sooner rather than later ⏰🚨⚠️  

Wise words of advice

 has boots 🥾 on the ground &amp; still says corn 🌽 crop is around 90 Mmt ( for now…)      🙄      “China is purchasing far more than needs to build stocks”?

A bold statement! 

Nobody knows what their stocks are, except that they’re probably 
a) exaggerated 
b) in a poor state Even rhetorical questions have question marks at they end.Brazil 🇧🇷will have 20-25 MMTs of corn 🌽 exportable surplus 🌽 July-November 
The 🌽 shortage story is more a 🇧🇷 domestic mkt story than a world story. 
⬇️ 👇 (Some 🇧🇷 corn 🌽 estimates are far below 90 Mmt however 🤷🏼‍♂️ )   So, do you think that the EU or Brazil will impose export restrictions on grain &amp; oilseeds? I don’t.

EU production is rebounding &amp; they’ll sell if price is right! 

In Brazil 🇧🇷 even with a disappointing safrinha corn crop they should still have a healthy exportable surplus._676  Sure they will, once they get off the naughty step! 
Australia 🇦🇺 is still paying the price for Prime Minister Scott Morrison calling for an inquiry into the origins of coronavirus…  Like USA 🇺🇸 Europe &amp; South America will continue to sell grains &amp; oilseeds to China with higher prices 

Prices will rally to reduce demand &amp; it’ll stimulate more production.

Thereafter (weather permitting) prices will fall.

“There is no cure for high prices like high prices!” Using food for fuel ⛽️ is problematic. Particularly with subsidies.  The initial premise is wrong.

Europe &amp; South America are still selling grains &amp; oilseeds to China 🇨🇳

Australia  🇦🇺 would sell to China, especially barley, if they could! Why..?Huh 🤔? Brian: The EU 🇪🇺 (notably France 🇫🇷)*will* sell their grain &amp; oilseeds to China 🇨🇳 &amp; 🇧🇷 🇦🇷 South America &amp; Ukraine 🇺🇦 will too!
